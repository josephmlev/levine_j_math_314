np instlation 8/28/19:
**********
pandas is not compatiable with my version of np
using pip install --upgrade numpy

returns

  Found existing installation: numpy 1.12.1
    Uninstalling numpy-1.12.1:
      Successfully uninstalled numpy-1.12.1
Successfully installed numpy-1.17.1

but 

print(np.__version__)

returns

1.12.1

Do I have two versions of np (pip and brew) as outlined at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28517937/how-can-i-upgrade-numpy
